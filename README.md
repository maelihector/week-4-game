# Crystal Collector

## What is this?

 An interactive memory game that shows a player a random number between 19-120 that the player must try to match exactly without going over. The player is offered four different crystals each holding a hidden number value between 1-12 that increases the players number by that hidden number when clicked. 

With each game, a  new random number is given, and the crystals are randomized and given new hidden values.
